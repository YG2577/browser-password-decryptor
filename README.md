## üß† How It Works

Browsers like Chrome save passwords encrypted using a master key stored in a file called `Local State`.  
This script does the following:

- Reads the master encryption key from the `Local State` file
- Extracts saved credentials from the browser's `Login Data` SQLite database
- Decrypts the passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM

## üöÄ Usage

To use this script to decrypt saved browser passwords:

1. **Find the folder that contains** both `Login Data` and `Local State`.  
   On Windows, this is usually located at:  
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`

2. **Open your terminal or command prompt** and navigate to the folder where this script is located.

3. **Run the script** using:
   ```bash
   python decrypt.py
3. When asked, paste the full path to the folder containing Login Data and Local State. For example:
   `C:\Users\YG\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`
4. The script will:
   - Extract saved website URLs, usernames, and passwords
   - Decrypt the passwords using Windows DPAPI + AES
   - Save the results into a file called output.txt in the same folder
     
5. Open output.txt to see the list of saved login credentials.

   
‚úÖ Result
After running, you‚Äôll see:
```bash
