## üß† How It Works

Browsers like Chrome save passwords encrypted using a master key stored in a file called `Local State`.  
This script does the following:

- Reads the master encryption key from the `Local State` file
- Extracts saved credentials from the browser's `Login Data` SQLite database
- Decrypts the passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM
